# Database & Migrations

## Schema

```mermaid
erDiagram
    User ||--o{ Session : "has many"

    User {
        int id PK
        string email UK
        string username "optional display name"
        string hashed_password
        datetime created_at
    }

    Session {
        string id PK "UUID"
        int user_id FK
        string name "optional session label"
        string username "copied from User at creation"
        datetime created_at
    }

    Thread {
        string id PK "UUID"
        datetime created_at
    }
```

**User** — one per account. Email is unique. `username` is optional and used to personalise the system prompt.

**Session** — one per conversation. A user can have many sessions. `username` is denormalised from `User` at creation time so chat requests never need an extra DB lookup. The session JWT scopes all chat requests.

**Thread** — mirrors LangGraph's `AsyncPostgresSaver` checkpoint thread. Tracks which threads exist in the app's context.

The LangGraph checkpointer also creates its own tables (`checkpoints`, `checkpoint_blobs`, `checkpoint_writes`) — these are managed by LangGraph itself, not by Alembic.

Long-term memory does **not** live in PostgreSQL: mem0 stores its embeddings in an external Qdrant instance, so there is no vector table here for Alembic to worry about.

## Migrations with Alembic

All schema changes are managed through Alembic. The app no longer calls `create_all()` on startup — Alembic owns the schema.

### Initial setup (fresh database)

```bash
make migrate              # applies all migrations to the database
```

### Creating a migration after model changes

```bash
# 1. Edit your SQLModel model (app/models/)
# 2. Generate the migration
make migration MSG="add phone number to user"

# 3. Review the generated file in alembic/versions/
# 4. Apply it
make migrate
```

### Other commands

```bash
make migrate-downgrade    # roll back the last migration
make migrate-history      # show the full migration history
```

Alembic reads DB credentials from your `.env` file (via `app/core/config.py`). Make sure the correct `APP_ENV` is set before running migrations.

### How autogenerate works

`env.py` imports all SQLModel models so their metadata is registered, then calls `alembic revision --autogenerate`. Alembic diffs the current DB schema against the models and generates the upgrade/downgrade functions.

External tables (the LangGraph checkpointer) are excluded via `include_object` in `alembic/env.py` so Alembic never touches them.

### Adding a new model

1. Create `app/models/your_model.py`
2. Import it in `alembic/env.py` alongside the other model imports
3. Run `make migration MSG="add your_model table"`


With Docker (`make docker-up`), this is handled automatically by the `db` service. For external databases (e.g. Supabase), enable the extension via the dashboard or SQL editor.
