"""Rule-based routing table for the Sprint 1 supervisor.

The single source of truth for how a message's text, together with the
requester's stored authority, maps to a capability route. No model is ever
consulted here: matching is a few dozen compiled regular expressions, so the
common path adds microseconds, not a network call.

How a decision is made:

1. The text is normalised (whitespace, curly apostrophes) and tested against
   every rule in ``ROUTING_RULES``, in order of consequence: mutations first
   (cohort, role, sprint, ceremony scheduling), then directory and calendar
   reads, then learner support, then workspace administration.
2. A *mutation* rule matches only imperative phrasing. A message that is
   question-shaped ("when should we schedule the retro?") and carries no second
   clause never routes to a mutation — it is a read, however many admin verbs
   it contains. Polite orders ("can you open sprint 2?") are not questions.
3. Mutation rules are gated on stored authority. For a requester with no cohort
   authority the match is kept but redirected to ``learner_support`` with the
   rule name suffixed ``_denied_role``, so the denial is observable and the
   learner-support specialist — which has no mutating tools at all — can say so.
   The tools re-check authority in code regardless of routing.
4. Every distinct route that matched is returned, de-duplicated by route, in
   rule order. Two or more routes make a multi-step plan. Nothing matched means
   ``general`` — the behaviour that worked before the supervisor existed.

The labelled sentences in ``routing_examples.py`` are the executable
specification of this table; extend both together.
